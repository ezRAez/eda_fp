### Questions

1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 
   1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the 
   total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 
   2002, 2005, and 2008.
2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, 
   Maryland (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == "𝟸𝟺𝟻𝟷𝟶") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting 
   system to make a plot answering this question.
3. Of the four types of sources indicated by the 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 (point, nonpoint, 
   onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen 
   decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have 
   seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting 
   system to make a plot answer this question.
4. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal 
   combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?
5. How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 
   in Baltimore City?
6. Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with 
   emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, 
   California (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == "𝟶𝟼𝟶𝟹𝟽"). Which city has seen greater changes 
   over time in motor vehicle emissions?
